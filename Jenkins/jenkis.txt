JENKINS CI
git clone
maven builds the java code and generates the artifacts(ear, war)
create a docker image
push image to the docker repo

JENKINS CD 
pulls the artifactactory from jfrog and deploy onto kubernetes

provision the aws ec2 intance
install Java, install jenkins
start jenkins
Access the web UI on port 8080
jenkins official website - https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/

can be installed from the root itself, no need of switching to /opt/
jenkins path - /var/lib/jenkins - has all the configuration files
sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y (<package-name>(java:latestversion))
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum install jenkins -y
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status  jenkins
sudo systemctl stop  jenkins
sudo systemctl restart  jenkins


For configuring the path like git, maven, java Managejenkins>Tools>git(UI flaunts, if we install the github plugin)>then add the path(in the cli use the command whereis git)


installation of maven on jenkins
setup maven on jenkins server
setup the environment variables
JAVA_HOME(for java), M2, M2_HOME(for maven)
install the maven plugin
configure the maven and Java
should be installed on /opt/
then cd maven > bin > ./mvn -v (gives the version of maven), but when we do it outside of the directory, it won't work that's why we need to add it in the environment variables, to set up the env variables we can update in the .bash_profile of the user which it gonna use or upate in the env variables, here we need to add the java path as well as maven path
==================================================================
M2_HOME=/opt/maven - path of maven where we've configured
M2=/opt/maven/bin - binary directory
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.20.0.8-1.amzn2.0.1.x86_64

find / -name jvm or whereis jvm
/usr/lib/jvm
cd /usr/lib/jvm

find / -name java-11*
/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.20.0.8-1.amzn2.0.1.x86_64
M2_HOME=/opt/maven 
M2=/opt/maven/bin 
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.20.0.8-1.amzn2.0.1.x86_64

# User specific environment and startup programs

PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$M2_HOME:$M2:$JAVA_HOME
source .bash_profile (for we need load them for the changes to get reflected)
echo $PATH
mvn -v
Next we need to tell the jenkins UI regarding the maven and java path
install the maven plugin
====================================================================


jenkins dashboard trip
in jenkins item/project/job refers the same
Manage jenkins sits outta the job, Manage jenkins is backbone for jenkins

integrating maven in jenkins
plugin for maven  - maven integration then opt install without restart then opt tools(present in Manage-jenkins), then maven reflects there, name it and select the desired version to enroll on our machine

integrating nexus in jenkins

plugin for nexus - nexus platform then install without restart then Manage jenkins >system > nexus > give the details of nexus hosted on ec2 > give the username and password then test the connection > then create a new job

jenkins upstream and downstream jobs
can be configured in configure > postbuild actions in the dropdwon of Add postbuild action(opt the build other projectsÂ´ ) under a specific job(A - for example)
If there are three jobs A, B and C then A is upstream to B and B is upstream to C and for downstrean it's vice-versa

setting up the build pipeline
build pipeline plugin should be installed

Master and slave node in jenkins
Master node means running on same server   but slave node, we can run the specific job in desired server - where it releives the burden on Master
slave node can be setup on linux as well as windows machine
Master node > Manage jenkins > Nodes

setting up the linux slave in jenkins

what is jenkins pipeline, jenkinsfile, benefits of jenkins and types of syntaxes in jenkins
