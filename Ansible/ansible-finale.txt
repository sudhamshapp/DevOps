#ansible adhoc commands - search on ansible documentation or on chatgpt
ansible all -i hosts -m ping(adhoc - command)
ansible all -i hosts -m setup(tells whether ubuntu, and linux belongs to which os_family)

ansible all -i hosts <filename> --list-hosts(lists the hosts)
ansible all -i hosts <filename> --check(dry-run)
ansible all -i hosts <filename> --syntax-check

installation of httpd and starting the services then stop the services and uininstall the httpd

Notify and handlers(lets assume without installation of httpd, we can't start the httpd service, if httpd is already installed, notify won't inform to the handler)
Gather Facts(Retrieve the system information from managed nodes, during the installation, it gonna perform a major task, we can also disable the gather_facts:no under hosts)
When condition(dependant on gather_facts), list and with_items(with_items are deprecated)
Ansible variables(we can define within the playbook, we can pass from external files, passing while running playbook via command line)
Tags(we can restrict our plays if a specific tag is called/invoked)
Error Handling in Ansible playbook(ignore_errors=yes, if a specific task isn't successful on any of the system, it proceeds further)

Ansible Vault(helps us to reatin the sensitive data such as passwords or keys in encrypted files rather than as plaintext in playbooks or Roles)(create, view, edit, encrypt, decrypt)
ansible-vault create <filename>
ansible-vault view <filename>
ansible-vault encrypt <filename>
ansible-vault decrypt <filename>

--ask-vault-pass(provide passsword while running plabook)
--vault-password-file(to pass a vault password through a file)


Ansible Roles(Roles let you automatically load related vars, files, tasks, handlers, and other Ansible artifacts based on a known file structure. After you group your content in roles, you can easily reuse them and share them with other users)
Reusability
ansible-galaxy init <rolename>
