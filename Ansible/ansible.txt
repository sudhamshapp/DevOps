default innventory file /etc/ansible/hosts


ANSIBLE INSTALLATION 
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y
ansible --version

control node(ansible installed machine) should have acces to managed nodes through password less authrntication
Inventory/hostfile has (list of managed nodes info i.e., private IPs)
playbooks - these are actual tasks need to be executed on target systems/manged nodes
Tasks: unit of action in ansible


PERFORM ALL THIS STUFF AS A ROOT USER
create a useradd ansadmin, passwd ansadmin then cat /etc/passwd - helps list the users
visudo - here add ansadmin under the root and paste the stuff like ALL NOPASSWORD=ALL (shift+g to go end of line, and / to search specific stuff)
Enable password based authentication 
/etc/ssh/sshd_config (search using /Password)
i) uncomment the Password authentication=yes
ii)comment the Password authentication=no
service/systemctl sshd restart


SWITCH TO THE ANSADMIN (sudo su - ansadmin)
ssh-keygen (press enter)
the keys gonna stored in the .ssh directory
we gonna copy rsa-public key onto target systems(ssh-copy-id private IP of target systems)
ansible all -m ping (test the connection b/w the control node and target systems)

ansible-playbook user.yml -i hosts --check
ansible-playbook user.yml -i hosts --syntax-check
ansible-playbook user.yml --limit localhost/privateip






Installation of Ansible 
provision ec2
setup hostname
create ansadmin user`
Add user to the sudoers file - so the ansadmin get the administrative privileges - visudo is the command then ansadmin ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL - helps execute any command without password
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config then comment the stuff
service sshd reload
generate ssh keys - key based authentication, for whatever server we wish to access we need to copy id_rsa.pub onto target  system, on target system on which location we need to copy? we get to know bro
enable password based login
install ansible


ssh-copy-id 172.31.29.98 - helps connect with docker host from ansible server
the ansible server and docker host should have the same user
