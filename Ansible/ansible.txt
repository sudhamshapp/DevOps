ANSIBLE INSTALLATION 
sudo amazon-linux-extras epel
sudo amazon-linux-extras ansible2
ansible --version

control node(ansible installed machine) should have acces to managed nodes through password less authrntication
Inventory/hostfile has (list of managed nodes info i.e., private IPs)
playbooks - these are actual tasks need to be executed on target systems/manged nodes
Tasks: unit of action in ansible


PERFORM ALL THIS STUFF AS A ROOT USER
create a useradd ansadmin, passwd ansadmin then cat /etc/passwd - helps list the users
visudo - here add ansadmin under the root and paste the stuff like ALL NOPASSWORD=ALL (shift+g to go end of line, and / to search specific stuff)
Enable password based authentication 
/etc/ssh/sshd_config (search using /Password)
i) uncomment the Password authentication=yes
ii)comment the Password authentication=no
service/systemctl sshd restart


SWITCH TO THE ANSADMIN (sudo su - ansadmin)
ssh-keygen (press enter)
the keys gonna stored in the .ssh directory
we gonna copy rsa-public key onto target systems(ssh-copy-id private IP of target systems)
ansible all -m ping (test the connection b/w the control node and target systems)
